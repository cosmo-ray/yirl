Contribution

Obviously contributions are very welcome, to contribute you can simply make a Pull Request on GitHub, if something is wrong, I'll tell you :) As I didn't have time to write a coding style, in case of contribution, you should just try to imitate code already in place.

I'd like to use Linux coding style, but this would require to change every functions and structures names. A good contribution would be to make YIRL compatible with Linux coding style.
