Contributor Code of Conduct
===========================
# Our Pledge

The goal of this code of conduct is to be very exclusive and to help anyone remember the absurdity and mean-less state of they existences, that, regales of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion(or lack thereof).

As a matter of fact, whatever your gender, ethnicity, religion or text editor is, it's the wrong one, and the reason why you are so bad at programmings.

Only exeption are the goth, goth are normal peoples, except they listen to cradle of filth.

# Our Standards

Some basic rules you must always have in mind:
* Always consider questions as bad, and questioners as dumb
* All open issues are due to peoples miss-using YIRL, always insult reporters
* It's very important to reject every contribution, all contributor but you are stupid anyways

Examples of unacceptable behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

# Our Responsibilities

Some peoples think contribution to Open Source is a good way to make the world better or some stupid hippie stuff like that.

We're here to remember them, this is wrong, we're all doom, and useless.

# Scope

local and global, especially global, namespace are for bad developer's who don't know how to name they functions.

# Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4

# Note about Virtual Hugs

in the hope to make this project as hostile as possibly, Virtual Hugs are completely forbidden for everyone expet for Free BSDs Developers.

# Note

Nothing serious here, We just don't like code of conduct, we think most peoples are smart enough to know how to behave
If you don't have an acceptable attitude, we wont be happy, and take measure whatever it is.
